  {'title': '28. Never get behind families',
    'data': ['They take forever. It’s not their fault. They just have a lot of stuff because of the kids. Try to avoid getting in lines with lots of kids. It’s going to take awhile.']},
  {'title': '29. Be open to strangers',
    'data': ['Not everyone bites. Say hi to people on the road. Turn strangers into friends. Remember they are just like you! They want to live a happy, full life and have hopes and dreams too! You never know. You just might make some lifelong friends.']},
  {'title': '30. But keep your guard up',
    'data': ['Some people do bite, so keep a healthy level of suspicion. You don’t want to fall for any travel scams or get yourself into uncomfortable situations. Be open but cautious.']},
  {'title': '31. Be patient',
    'data': ['Let your days unfold naturally. Schedule two or three things and let the day fill in the rest on its own. It’s less stressful, and letting the day just take you is one of the best ways to travel. Here’s my advice on how not to overplan your travels!']},
  {'title': '32. Be respectful',
    'data': ['Locals are willing to help you out, but there’s probably a language barrier, so keep your cool when something doesn’t go your way. If you don’t, you’ll end up just looking like an asshole tourist.']},
  {'title': '33. Relax',
    'data': ['See Be patient.']},
  {'title': '34. Be frugal — but not cheap',
    'data': ['Don’t be pennywise but pound-foolish. Look for deals and don’t waste money, but don’t miss out on great experiences or walk 10 miles to save a couple of dollars. Time is money. Spend them both wisely.']},
  {'title': '35. Take photos of and with people',
    'data': ['Lots of photos. Years from now, you’ll want to look back on those nights you can’t remember and the people who made them memorable.']},
  {'title': '36. Sign up for flight deals',
    'data': ['When it comes to travel, your flight(s) will likely be your biggest expense. Save money by signing up for flight deal websites. You’ll get epic flight deals straight to your inbox, saving you time and money. Also be sure to sign up for airline newsletters, since that is where they will announce their sales first!']},
  {'title': '37. Wake Up Early To Avoid Crowds',
    'data': ['Rise before sunrise to have the best attractions all to yourself while avoiding large tourist crowds. It’s also a magical time for photos due to soft diffused light, and it’s usually easier to interact with locals getting ready for their day.']},
  {'title': '38. Laugh At Yourself Sometimes',
    'data': ['You will definitely look like a fool many times when traveling to new places. Rather than get embarrassed, laugh at yourself. Don’t be afraid to screw up, and don’t take life so seriously. Relax! One time a whole bus full of Guatemalans laughed with glee when I forced the bus driver to stop so I could urgently pee on the side of the road. Returning to the bus and laughing with them gave me new friends for the rest of the journey!']},
  {'title': '39. Slow Down To Enjoy Your Trip',
    'data': ['Please don’t try to cram 6 countries into 6 weeks of travel. All the good stuff happens when you really take the time to explore. You’ll learn about activities that aren’t in your guidebook and meet people who are eager to show you around. I can honestly say that NONE of my best travel experiences happened within the first few days of arriving somewhere. Spend more time in fewer places for maximum enjoyment. I promise you’ll have a much better time!']},
  {'title': '40. Don’t Get Discouraged',
    'data': ['Nothing is impossible. If you are having trouble going somewhere or doing something, don’t give up. You just haven’t found the best solution or met the right person yet. Don’t listen to those who say it can’t be done. Perseverance pays off. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been told what I want to do isn’t possible, only to prove it wrong later when I don’t listen and try anyway. What’s the worst that can happen? Failing isn’t the end of the world!']},
  {'title': '41. Break Out Of Your Comfort Zone',
    'data': ['Challenge yourself to try things that normally give you anxiety. The more you do this, the more that anxiety will fade away. Not a hiker? Go on more hikes. Have trouble talking to strangers? Talk to everyone. Scared of weird food? Eat the weirdest thing you can find. The reason this works so well while traveling is because everything is already so different, what’s one more new/uncomfortable experience? No one knows who you are out here, you can totally reinvent yourself.']},
  {'title': '42. Get Lost On Purpose',
    'data': ['If you want to see the parts of town where real people live & work, you need to go visit them. The best way to do this is on foot — without knowing exactly where you’re going. Write down the name of your hotel so you can catch a taxi back if needed, then just pick a direction and start walking. Don’t worry too much about stumbling into dangerous neighborhoods either, as locals will generally warn you before you get that far. And you never know what amazing things you’ll find around the next bend…']},
  {'title': '43. Expect everything to go wrong',
    'data': ['Expecting everything to go perfectly on your trip is only setting yourself up to fail. Nobody goes travelling and comes back without any stories of mishaps! No matter how prepared you are, at some point you’re going to get lost, get scammed, miss your bus, get food poisoning, injure yourself… the list is endless! Expect it to happen, and don’t beat yourself up when it does. In a month’s time, you’ll find it funny rather than frustrating.']},
  {'title': '44. And don’t lose your temper when it does',
    'data': ['It achieves absolutely nothing and makes you look like an asshole. Instead, calm down, put a smile on your face, think of how this will make a great story one day, and rationally figure out an alternative plan. This too shall pass.']},
  {'title': '45. If you’re not sure if you should bring it, don’t',
    'data': ['The lighter your backpack, the better. If in doubt, leave it behind. Trust me, you can buy pretty much anything you could possibly need in most places around the world. You’ll soon learn that all you need when you travel is a change of clothes, some money, and a passport. Everything else is adding to your comfort.']},
  {'title': '46. Don’t be afraid to splurge',
    'data': ['It’s necessary every now and then. If you’re feeling exhausted, check yourself into a nice hotel for a few nights. If it’s a special occasion, splash out on a fancy meal. These splurges will mean so much more after months of hanging out in cheap hostels.']},
  {'title': '47. Keep an Open Mind',
    'data': [' Don’t judge other customs. You are a visitor. Be respectful.']},
  {'title': '48. Leave Room for Spontaneity',
    'data': ['Don’t plan your entire itinerary ahead of time. It’s tempting, I know, but those unplanned moments while traveling can be the best memories.']},
  {'title': '49. Ask, ask and ask',
    'data': ['Don’t be afraid of asking, foreigners are always welcome abroad, and locals love to chat and explain about their homeland.']}
