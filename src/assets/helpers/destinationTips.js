  {'title': '58. Travel by yourself at least once',
    'data': ['You’ll learn a lot about yourself and how to become independent. It’s a cliché, but it’s true. Traveling solo taught me how to fend for myself, talk to people, and handle unfamiliar situations with ease. It’s made me comfortable with myself, helped me learn about what I’m capable of, and allowed me to be super selfish and do whatever I want! It can take some getting used to if you’ve never done it before but do it at least once. Make yourself uncomfortable and surprise yourself. You’ll learn valuable life skills when you push yourself!']},
  {'title': '59. But don’t be afraid to get purposefully lost',
    'data': ['Wandering aimlessly through a new city is a good way to get to know it, get off the beaten path, and away from the tourists. You might be surprised by the hidden gems you find. I like to wander around and try to find my way without using Google Maps!']},
  {'title': '60. Always visit the local tourism office',
    'data': ['They know about everything going on in town. They can point you to free activities, special events happening during your stay, and everything in between. They even offer discounts on attractions and transportation. It is their job to help you experience the destination better. It’s amazing how many travelers skip this when they are visiting somewhere but, as a savvy traveler, you know to use this resource! This is probably one of the most underused travel tips in the world. Use the tourism board! Save money!']},
  {'title': '61. Learn basic phrases in the native language of your destination',
    'data': ['The locals will appreciate it and it will make your interactions easier. You don’t need to master the language but learning a few things like “Hello,” “Goodbye,” “Thank you!”, “Where’s the bathroom?” will go a long way to endearing yourself with the locals. They’ll like that you tried.']},
  {'title': '62. Read a history book',
    'data': ['You can’t understand a place’s present if you don’t know anything about its past. Read up on the destinations you are visiting. It will give you a deeper understanding of this place you’ve wanted to see for so long!']},
  {'title': '63. Lunchtime is the best time to visit historical sites',
    'data': ['Be a contrarian. You’ll have fewer crowds getting in your way as big tour buses, groups, and most travelers head to lunch. It’s always best to visit an attraction super early, late, or when people eat. You’ll have even the most popular places to yourself!']},
  {'title': '64. Take free walking tours',
    'data': ['Besides being free, these tours will give you a good orientation and background of the city you are visiting. I love, love, love taking walking tours when I travel. You pass the time, you get to pepper the guide with questions, and you get to learn so much about where you are! Take a walking tour when you travel! Here are some lists of my favorite free walking tour companies in the world']},
  {'title': '65. Get city attraction cards',
    'data': ['']},
  {'title': '66. Avoid TripAdvisor',
    'data': ['TripAdvisor is fine when you need opening hours or an address, but when it comes to reviews I ignore it completely. People always leave a negative review when something bad happens but rarely leave a positive review when something good happens so the reviews tend to be skewed. On top of that, it’s very easy to create fake reviews and make a place seem better than it is. Many hotels and restaurants hire firms to artificially inflate their reviews on the platform. Additionally, TripAdvisor has been known to take down reviews that are overly negative as well reviews on sexual assualt. Use TripAdvisor with caution. Or better yet, don’t use it at all.']},
  {'title': '67. Wear sunscreen',
    'data': ['Do no forget it, sun it is bad for your skin.']},
  {'title': '68. Don’t put anything in your back pockets',
    'data': ['You’re basically asking to be pickpocketed']},
  {'title': '69. Change money or Cash out',
    'data': ['If you carried some money from your own Currency as soon as you step you should change some money, do it if you can somewhere but not in the Airport, normally they take more commission, also you should cash out in the ATMs you have close.']}
