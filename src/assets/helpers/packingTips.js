  {'title': '1. Always pack a towel', 'data': ['It’s the key to successful galactic hitchhiking and plain common sense. You never know when you will need it, whether it’s at the beach, on a picnic, or just to dry off. While many hostels offer towels, you never know and carrying a small towel won’t add that much weight to your bag.']},
  {'title': '2. Buy a small backpack/suitcase', 'data': ['By purchasing a small backpack (I like something around 35/40 liters), you will be forced you to pack light and avoid carrying too much stuff. Humans have a natural tendency to want to fill space so if you pack light but have lots of extra room in your bag, you’ll end up going “well, I guess I can take more” and then regret it.']},
  {'title': '3. Pack light, clothes for no more than seven days', 'data': ['It’s OK to wear the same t-shirt a few days in a row. Take half the clothes you think you will need…you won’t need as much as you think. Write down a list of essentials, cut it in half, and then only pack that! Plus, since you bought a small backpack like I said, you won’t have much room for extra stuff anyways!']},
  {'title': '4. But take extra socks',
    'data': ['You’ll lose a bunch to laundry gremlins, wear and tear, and hiking so packing extra will come in handy. I only take a few more than I need. Nothing beats a fresh pair of socks!']},
  {'title': '5. When you go out, take only what you need',
    'data': ['Limit the amount of cash and bank cards you carry with you, so if something does happen, you can easily recover. Never take more than one credit card or ATM card with you. Limit what you carry!']},
  {'title': '6. Always carry a lock',
    'data': ['They come in handy, especially when you stay in dorms and need to lock your stuff up. Carry a small combination lock with you when you travel. Don’t use one with keys because, if you lose the keys, you’re screwed!']},

  {'title': '7. Make extra copies of your passport and important documents',
    'data': ['Don’t forget to e-mail a copy to yourself too. You never know when you might need to have some sort of documentation with you and might not want to carry your original. Additionally, if your passport gets stolen having a copy will come in handy for your police report.']},

  {'title': '8. Pack always a flashlight',
    'data': ['It will let you see at night, you avoid stepping on stuff.']},

  {'title': '9. Take an empty metal water bottle through airport security and fill it up at your gate',
    'data': ['Drink from the tap if you can — you’ll save money and help the environment. If you’re going somewhere where you can’t drink the water, be sure to get a water bottle with a filter.']},

    'data': ['If your bag gets lost, this will help identify it more easily and speed up the process of having your travel insurance reimburse you.']},

  {'title': '11. Get good shoes',
    'data': ['You walk a lot when you travel. Don’t beat up your feet. Love them as much as they love you, and they’ll take you to amazing places.']},

  {'title': '14. Bring Your Own Water Bottle',
    'data': ['If you haven’t noticed, humans are destroying the planet with plastic waste. Constantly buying bottled water is incredibly bad for the environment! But tap water isn’t always safe everywhere either…']},

  {'title': '15. Always, always pack your things the night before your early morning flight',
    'data': ['The people I hate most when I travel are those who set their alarm for 4 a.m. and then proceed to spend the next hour packing their bags and rustling what sounds like forty thousand plastic bags. Don’t do this! Pack your bag the night before, so you can slip out without disturbing anyone’s sleep.']},
  {'title': '16. A dry bag is more useful than you think',
    'data': ['Dry bags are amazing for keeping your valuables safe on boat trips and for protecting any electronics you have in your daypack when it starts to rain. I even take mine to the beach when I’m travelling solo so that I can take my stuff in the ocean with me and not have to worry someone’s going to steal everything.']},
  {'title': '17. Always Bring a Sarong, even if you are a man',
    'data': ['Sarongs can be used as a wrap when you are cold, a towel, a curtain, or a piece of clothing that can be worn dozens of different ways. Solid colors are great, but if you want something that stands out. Also when you have to enter a holy place, where you for sure could buy outside the holy place, what MUCH more expensive!']},

    'data': ['A few important items should always go in your carry-on. A swimsuit is also a good idea if you are going on a beach vacation. You can buy most of these things if your bag gets lost, but having them in your carry-on will save you money and time if your luggage gets lost in transit.']},

    'data': ['Batteries die. Your good mood shouldn’t.']}
