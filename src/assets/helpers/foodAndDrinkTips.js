The closer you are to tourist attractions the more you are going to pay and the worse the food (and service). Use websites like Yelp, Google Maps, Foursquare, or Open Rice to find some delicious and popular restaurants around you. Additionally, never eat anywhere the menu is in like 6 languages! That means the restaurant is just for tourists!']},
