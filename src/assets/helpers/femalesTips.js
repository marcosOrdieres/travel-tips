  {'title': '93. What Clothes to Bring',
    'data': ['In places where clothing is cheap, such as Southeast Asia and India, don’t stress too much about having a complete wardrobe ready to go before you take off. Just about every girl I met in those regions wore clothing she’d bought on the road. It will suit the climate and at $3-$6 USD per garment, won’t break the bank.',
      'In Europe, Oceania, or anywhere remote, where you might either not be able to find cheap clothing or buy it on the road, bring everything you think you’ll need. These suggest packing lists will help:',
      'a) 5–7 thin and simple tank tops or sleeveless tops that can easily mix and match with different bottoms',
      'b) 2–3 pairs of shorts of varying lengths. Avoid denim in humid countries, as it takes a long time to line dry.',
      'c) 2 long skirts or dresses for conservative environments that require modesty — and they breathe better than pants',
      'd) 2–3 pairs of light cotton pants and/or leggings. 9 pairs of whatever underwear you find the most comfortable. 2 pairs of thin socks',
      'e) 1 pair of hiking or running shoes. 1 pair of flip-flops (jandals, thongs) or sandals. A hat to cover your face'

    'data': ['I’m often asked about buying toiletries on the road, and I’m happy to report that it’s both easy and straightforward finding shampoo, conditioner, deodorant, and soap. Ladies abroad use these things, too.',
      'Pantene and Dove products seem to be universal, and with the exception of a few really off-the-grid places, such as tiny islands and extremely poor areas where people mostly subsistence-farm, you’ll be able to find basic toiletries easily on the road.',
      'Basic toiletry packing list includes:',
      'a) 1 hanging toiletry bag for easy use in shared bathrooms',
      'b) Refillable travel bottles (shampoo, conditioner, face soap. Small container of body wash',
      'c) Face wash to siphon into a smaller tube',

      'f) Toothbrush, toothpaste, and floss. At least one deodorant. Sunscreen',
      'g) Tweezers. Eyeglasses repair kit. Nail clippers. Makeup',
      'h) 1–2 palettes of eye shadow (smoky and neutrals). 1 light powder foundation and bronzer. 2–3 application brushes. 1–2 eyeliner and mascara bottles',
      'For items such as prescriptions, the ease of traveling with them will heavily depend on what you need and how much you can get up front, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach. The best way to handle it is to talk to your doctor and insurance regarding how much you can get before you leave and how to best take it across borders.',
      'Remember that in much of the world, doctors aren’t too expensive to visit and it’s possible to get prescriptions written and filled on the road. Some developing countries will not even require a prescription for some items, from prescription shampoos and skin creams to anti-anxiety medications.'
